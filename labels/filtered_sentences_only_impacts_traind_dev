Because it was fake, as in no drugs in it, I withdrew really bad (as in I know what hell is) the whole week family was in town.
I was an OTC codeine addict myself before starting on Buprenorphine maintenance (Nurofen plus specifically), and taking up to 4 boxes of 32 tablets each containing 200mg of ibuprofen (yep: that' s over 25G of ibuprofen a day!)
I have mentioned I was in a really bad cult rehab before.
In PA at a 28 day detox / rehab they used methadone to get me off of bupe.
Then one overdoses and dies because their parents got a divorce when the husband got caught cheating with trannys instead of
Truth is, I was in the psych ward from Tuesday afternoon until this evening.
I went into drug-induced psychosis, which is honestly the scariest thing I have ever experienced - and I am so lucky that I snapped out of the psychotic episode and went back to being my 'self' who I am today.
You' ll feel a little tired and crummy the first week but more sub won' t stop that, it' s the withdrawal from the stimulant / antidepressant alkaloids in kratom that Suboxone won' t touch
Outpatient and MAT is how I got clean, she has to want it tho, as the saying goes.
Withdrawal can give extreme anxiety, and I mean the worst!
The fact that I can go to my doctor and not only get a prescription which was instrumental in my stopping, but that I also get to talk about addiction with a professional is amazing.
This was in the late 1990's, and in the year 2000, I was tired of it, I had no money, and my girlfriend, and I were strung out, bad.
I hope you choose to stay clean because it is absolutely NOT worth going back to that hell that I just pulled myself out of after 20 years of being a worthless scumbag.
I was a homeless junkie on the streets of Florida.
Coming off a heavy fent / h habit it took 3 - 4 days to get stable on subs, and that was even after I already WD for about 3 days.
Years ago when I was still using other opiates, if I was using say OxyContin for example, I would have to wait 24 hours (which always felt like years) after my last use before taking the subs, or else I would get horrible, horrible precipitated withdrawal.
But comming off a small amount of sub like you are, the worst part is that anxiety and restlessness.
But by 11 I realized I was actually totally tweaking like never before.
We lost everything during our drug use before we met each other and after.
I tried nine rehabs and methadone and I relapsed every time.
It sucks, bad, I was on 170mg, and stopped, it was like 6 months of withdrawals, not pretty, and I don't recommend it
I had a tooth suddenly feel like it was hollow and I saw a big hole in it.
Its very interesting how u went to AA for so many years bc I did the same and it took a while but finally hearing similar stuff helped me decide subs and its so much better after being stabilized.
Ended up with a bad fent habit and withdrawing last Christmas Eve in front of my whole extended family.
I can't tell you how much the fear and disappointment I saw in my sisters eyes, when she saw me in withdrawal, broke me and motivated me.
I was so brainwashed by that hell hole.
My drug of choice were simple opiates like darvocets that started my addiction and moved to lortabs, Norco, hydrocodone.
I'm very thankful that after all of the ods I've had I never hurt myself with lasting damage that I can tell.
It's been quite the journey but I've managed to go from living in an alley for 2 years when at my rock bottom to having a stable life that i legally pay for and healthy relationships with friends and family.
So i did 45 days in a rehab here in michigan.
I copped on day 6 and went on a 2.5 week bender and when that ended my withdrawal was worse than before (although that def had something to do with the fent).
Yep, years of abuse took a toll, I had to have what was left of my top teeth pulled, so no I ha e dentures.
Gives you energy and kills pain and anxiety
Just finished my 9 week program.
The one I got for Christmas has no dope in it, and I was withdrawing super hard infront of my whole extended family.
I regularly opened up and downed 2 boxes of Nurofen Plus a day for nearly 10 years (because addiction is a bitch), yet 50% of the time I'd open it from the wrong end even though I knew the right end was the one with the N on
I threw myself into pwd 3 fucking times last month.
I seriously lost everything that I cared about other then my family.
I used this to get off a mild addiction like 5 years ago, but eventually it just led me back to the opiates.
I was driving to the store and had to stop every few minutes to vomit burning acid.
The only drug I take is Buprenorphine for opiate addiction.
Tried AA / NA fuck even went to rehab for a month but nope the only thing that' s ever helped me here is subs.
It took me almost six months to totally kick it, and I still didn't feel right.
Even the stomach issues for me.
I'm in subs now because I was a codeine addict.
I didn't know it could kill you, I've had cotton fever so bad a couple times where I was shaking so bad I was trembling head to toe and thought I was going to die
I only came here with a couple bags of clothes and my xbox, I am truly starting over at this point.
I get out of rehab on march 6th
I have major sleep issues after screwing around with pregabalin too much and developing a functional neurological disorder (cop our excuse by the neurologist IMHO!).
Im doing outpatient stuff now.
I am in recovery from heroin addiction.
I really don't care how long I have to stay on them because the way I was living my life before, it's a miracle that I wasn't killed by someone or overdosed and died.
I was worried I'd lose my job because I'd be unable to function for a wee.
The biggest thing that clicked in my mind was really hearing others talk in meetings, and i could not deny any more that using I was no good for anybody and starting to be miserable.
I wanted to die, I mean we are talking bout six months of withdrawals.
Having an addiction background, I understand why he might say no.
Ended up getting pulled over with no license and lost my truck and went to jail.
Did anyone here have a terrible rehab experience?
Last time I took them I only took 2 mg and blacked out oh, I drink some fertilizer because I thought it was chocolate milk.
Headaches while on the opiates.
If you can only use H cuz the fent withdrawal is hell
So as most of us know, withdrawal is very similar to the flu.
I just called a 1800 number and was in a rehab the next day.
I withdrew from H over Thanksgiving and it sucked bad but not nearly as bad as my fent withdrawal this week.
Needless to say it didn't work out that way and when I tried to switch back to kratom it didn't even come close to touching my WD.
But this was in full-blown fent withdrawal as I was switching to Suboxone.
I did a 28 day detox / rehab back in 2018, it was a 12step based rehab but like you I know that isn't for me but was the time I needed to get my head right.
My nose is killing me and I need to find a new ROA but I heard so much bad shit about IV coke that I don't even want to try it.
I went to nine rehabs and tried methodone before I discovered suboxone and it worked for me immediately and has continued to work for me for a long time.
Zero motivation, feelings of despair, panic, like I was walking under water, etc.
Whether it's capsules, tea, or t & w, consumption of any dose makes me hurl up a geyser of stomach acid within an hour of dosing.
Panic attack feeling.
I later learned - after luckily coming back to normal from a complete full blown drug induced psychosis (was 51 - 50'd for 3 days).
It' s addiction ultimately, and I'm so thankful I was able to start the subutex ''submission_title: - Does it matter how you take your medicine?
I have just gone to my drug clinic and low and behold a old school mate from 15 years ago now works there she reads my whole file, shocked I was hooked on heroin, benzos, been to hospital for OD etc...
I am a recovering addict and I overdosed at 19 (I'm 25 now) and I was charged with disorderly conduct (only thing on my record).
If you're getting reported for 'hard braking' enough for you to say it 'needs to stop!'
Addiction is fucking hard.
I have cotton mouth and I feel really weird.
For me, if we can achieve an opium high without the addiction, I would be so happy
But i felt chills while i was sweating my balls off.
So, one issue I would like to talk about is, can my mother legally cut us off like this from seeing our daughter?
Does anybody else switch from kratom to other opiates and notice weird effects with withdrawls?
I' ve been on 2mg for over 2 years and when I' ve tried to taper off I started to feel depressed.
Yes, its hell, I went from 170mg to 0, and it took me over 6 months to even start to become normal.
I did a detox at the Coleman Institute years ago when my parents first found out I was using.
I was homeless because of drugs.
Can't tell you how great life is not having to pick up every other day or spend all my hard earned pay check on dope.
I was homeless and ready to kill myself.
Submission_text: - This reminds me so much of how I felt my first week in rehab.
I had this problem and found out that I had hypochlorhydria (very low stomach acid) likely caused by the kratom.
I lost a pregnancy when I went cold turkey and my doctor told me this was a possible reason why.
A long time ago I once had blacked out for basically a couple / few days and I wake up one day to a call and when I answer the guy says '' Hi (name), was it today you were planing on starting? ''
I have overdosed many times and I can tell you he felt no pain, no fear, no discomfort.
It was effed up and then about a week later it fell out.
It' s taken a long while for the ulcers to heal, but otherwise good (and much safer than the service users we see on cocodamol)
Thats how I think about my own recovery, but I know it wouldn't have happened without going to AA and just listening.
My son was born on methadone, and they told us he would be fine, although he had to endure withdrawal in The NICU.
I then took kratom twice daily for almost two years and quickly became physically addicted to it.
I ended up quitting kratom, waited for PAWS to start clearing up and then transitioned to vaping after about a month clean from kratom.
Pain, tiredness, depression, anxiety, sleep, sweats and chills.
The tooth that fell out was already fucked up so it wasn't a big deal but the fact that a second tooth now seems to have a hole in it is making me freak out and think it is an emergency ya
I started using and I changed and became a different person.
Feel incredibly anxious.
To add, I too have likely damaged my brain when I was young.
I was on subs 10 + years then got off of them in a rehab for 10 - 11 months in which I tried Vivitrol in that time.
I think you're good, when I withdrew off fent day 3 I was feeling worse, not even close to better
My son was born addicted to methadone, they said there was nothing they could do, but let him withdrawal.
I did meth it for 2 days and has sores all over my body.
I quit a several year oxy addiction without rehab, but I medically detoxed myself, went to daily meetings for the first 90 days, went to addiction counseling once a week, and spent most of my free time keeping myself busy with healthy activities.
I'm on probation, and I'm on suboxone, but they don't know, cause I have never told them, nor do I intend to
I use to feel the same way about groups and therapy until I found the right combo to work for me.
I got so sick and tired of the stupid AA meetings and NA meetings that just did not work.
Speaking to doctors at my local hospital about it I was advised to put in explicitly words like 'On Buprenorphine 6MG daily for opiate addiction maintenance.
Her husband would call me asking if I had seen her because she hadn't been home for days.
Ive ODed a few times n got brought back.
But now I test it with doing half of one first because there's some fire flying around that's been putting me and my friends in the hospital.
For myself, I went to meetings fresh out of rehab and very vulnerable.
I can't believe withdrawal is taking this long for such a short duration of use
I even tried to walk, but never made it, I went to the hospital, and they gave me a few atiivan.
Permanent neurological damage as a result, and I know many others in a similar boat
Now about another week later I got another tooth that now has a hole and feels hollow.
I have lost friends, family members and a lot of people's trust.
I actually grew more hair getting on subs after a fent and kratom habit.... I think kratom caused the hair loss
I still feel like shit today and I'm having brain zaps (first time ever from meth).
I need to do this before I join so many that were my friends that are now dead.
Upon getting a portion of her mind back after id been in jail for like 3.5 months without hearing from her she apparently decided to start talking to her ex bf about possibly getting together.
I highly recommend talking with a pain specialist because most of us in this sub are taking sub to recover from addiction.
Took me two days and high mg dose of subs to break through my fent withdrawal.
I had to wait like 38 hours and it finally worked.
When I say super humanly sociable I mean I 'm a fucking beast at basically everything I do when I 'm on dissos.
I'm pretty sure I ruined my life though in all seriousness but I honestly haven't smoked a single cigarette this whole time
But when I got into heroin, rent couldn't be bothered with anymore.
With the help of a friend, I scheduled an intake at a clinic to start a 30 - day outpatient detox program on Tuesday 12 / 31.
Now at 4pm, 8 hours later I'm still tweaking out.
I could work but and pay bills but I was paying bills late and constantly making excuses at work.
Felt hopeless but rehab definitely saved my life.
i stayed at fucked up rehabs before Have you?
I did a 28 day detox / rehab to get off of 8mg.
I have definitely been to rock bottom at points in my life, this part of my life is paradise compared to then.
killed my stomach.
A little sad but nothing terrible.
In May of 2018, I spent three weeks using my drug of choice (IV heroin) before going to a partial hospitalization program for treatment.
When I was withdrawing from heroin there were times where I'd lay in bed and literally barely touch my dick and would cum like three times in a row.
When i was in rehab i used to carry a pack on me with one cigarette in it to show people when they asked lol
Kratom withdrawal was actually worse than Suboxone withdrawal for me to be totally honest.
Then i had pwd when i tried to get back on subs
But by 11 I realized I was actually totally tweaking like never before.
Til I had blown my very last dollar.
I did an eight day detox that ended a week ago.
Thank you:) I went to a methodone clinic for awhile.
The one I got for Christmas has no dope in it, and I was withdrawing super hard infront of my whole extended family.
I was able to get off of them after a year and a half of addiction thanks to Suboxone and therapy.
Had 12 ulcers they could count in the stomach / duodenum and also ulceration of the small intestine as well.
I had been with my then bf for over 6 years and we had developed a nasty drug habit resulting in losing car, home, and possessions.
I've been through 3 rehab systems none worked.
I od from snorting a 5 $ cap.
I listened to them and tried that and I almost died when I relapsed.
I have gotten out of some gnarly PWD by shooting up half gram shots of heroin.
I was homeless like 4 months ago.
I am going on my 3rd therapist from the same place over 2 years.
Kratom nearly killed me because it made me suicidal
And I never thought I would live to see 40, but here I am 39 and going strong.
Then I got tired n fell asleep.
Because of this situation, I lost my best friend.
YES absolutely I was so addicted and always craving that shit as long as I had it I abused it.
A few weeks later, I went to my Suboxone appointment and I did my drug test and it was positive for opioids.
She says I have no right to be angry - I used, I lost my job.
I' ve tried kratom and found myself in the cycle of taking more and more, having to rush to buy it and running out before I should' ve (basically, addiction).
Kinda craving to use recently, but I'm on Vivitrol which helps me psychologically
Im homeless.
It all led up to me having a legitimate psychotic break, landing me in the hospital (thank god not arrested), and when my therapist found out, he was as helpful as he could be.
Then I felt terrible.
I' ve tried tapering down and gotten to about 0.25mg before getting extremely depressed.
I left hospital with a strong opiate addiction that lasted nearly 18 years that I'm still battling today.
I ended up being committed.
Tell that to someone who' s on subs because of a codeine addiction
Before that I had tried 9 rehabs, those stupid NA 12 step groups (* that are filled with sexual predators who were court ordered to go there because maybe they assaulted someone while high on drugs, *) and methodone.
When I'm really depressed I get so upset that I'm an addict, that I'll always be that way, and I feel useless and hopeless.
I overdosed five times while using oh, and usually it was when I shot it.
My BMI was in the 16 range.
They continued to get worse and worse, and since I was using all day every day (as is common with meth), it probably took only a month after I began using meth before I went into full on drug induced psychosis.
I was homeless and ready to kill myself.
Im lost and feeling let down and depressed.
Meanwhile I was a hardcore codeine addict, talked about it openly on social media, flew out to UAE with 12 boxes of nurofen plus and came back without any issue.
Because I am an addict, and even after almost two years of being on kratom, I still get high twice a day, every single day.
I got to day 3 of hellish WD, picked up a bag, and I decided to check into a clinic rather than roll the dice with the mystery fent / H powder again.
They help the restlessness and sleep.
I OD'd off a snorting a 5 $ cap.
I'm sorry to say that after reading all of the comments, I was hoping I wouldn' t have to share this but it sounds like the most likely scenario: I had a drug-induced psychotic break and what you' re describing is essentially exactly what happened.
I am 2 years off of benzos and working a sub program.
''submission_title: - My girlfriend of 1.5yrs left me the day after Valentine's Day, because she felt we had no future together, and I just want to stop feeling like I'm dying inside.
I go to AA but NEED more.
I've dealt with the same thing, being on probation and not being able to smoke.
I am only 22 and I have about 5 years of opiate use under my belt and I couldn't take it anymore and went into treatment and got clean.
She would disappear for a week at a time when I was a kid.
Makes the pain tolerable.
I was addicted to heroin for 8 years like you and I am proud to say that it has been over 15 years since I last did any.
They give me energy and make me talkative.
Last time i overdosed in my running car, whoever called the cops stole my wallet out of my glove box with $2,400 American dollars in it
I've put myself into deep debt that I somehow climbed out of.
Oh I was already an opiate addict and I also have severe mental health issues.
Chills washed off me and I perked up.
You may know this already but I' ve been on opiates on and off for 20 years i had a pain management doc that made all his male patients see the endocrine or hormone doc in to get my testosterone levels checked and they were about the amount of a woman' s when the results got back I was 30 at the time had no drive or energy which was the result of my testosterone being slapped away by the opiates.
I would have been dead or just another shit stain on society.
Within 3 months I was strung out to the point I was homeless and no one wanted me around
I am on Suboxone for opioid dependency and CT benzos and coke 2 years in rehab and have been off of them since, which has been a real struggle not going to lie.
This is coming from someone who has been both addicted to heroin and cocaine.
I' ve tapered down to about 0.25mg in the past and after being on that dose for 3 weeks I started to feel a major depressive wave coming on.
My partner killed himself, I lost my kid for awhile, my job, and every possession and piece of clothing I owned.
(It's a fever reducer and anti-inflammatory) Good luck, I know from experience the hell of fent withdrawal.
I couldn't have a normal life because you can't use everyday and hide it for long in a serious relationship.
I've been in outpatient therapy and on suboxone for nearly ten months now, and every day it is more clear to me that the drugs were not killing me (loved those) but the shame, the isolation and the heavy secrets were.
However, mom was still running the streets and ending up in the hospital every so often.
They ' re mad at me because Andrew OD 'd while I was with him.
I' ve been through some horrible addictions and withdrawals.
Methadone about killed me, I mean like over six months of withdrawals, no fun, no fun at all
I was using fent and Kratom didn't do shit for my WD.
In my teen years and 20's I drank, partied, and got addicted to opiates.
I've been arrested and charged with a felony, that I got out of with a lot of hard work.
I am a recovering addict and I overdosed at 19 (I 'm 25 now) and I was charged with disorderly conduct (only thing on my record).
Meetings and seeing a suboxone doctor.
He lost a 80k / yearly job and I lost my family.
''submission_title: - Help with my Probation submission_subreddit: - weed I've dealt with the same thing, being on probation and not being able to smoke.
Outpatient has saved my life, quite literally.
Just a lil spark of energy and can't sleep
I've been in outpatient therapy and on suboxone for nearly ten months now, and every day it is more clear to me that the drugs were not killing me (loved those) but the shame, the isolation and the heavy secrets were.
Last 6 months my addiction took a hard turn and I started sniffing fentanyl.
As so many have said now I have to deal with all the problems I put off getting high, so I hear u.
Took 3 days to feel okay.
Now I'm 28 years old and battling a decade long heroin addiction.
I drop of at 170mg, and I was sick, sick for about 6 months, and even then it took a while to feel normal
Cop came and I had to be Narcaned.
